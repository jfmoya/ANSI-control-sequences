# ANSI-control-sequences

## Description
ANSI_plotter.py is a Python script that demonstrates how to use ANSI control sequences to create simple plots in the terminal. The script draws axes and plots a circular pattern in the terminal window using cursor control sequences, adding a dynamic visual display directly in the console.

## Features
Uses ANSI escape sequences to move the cursor, clear the screen, and hide/show the cursor.
Plots axes and a dynamically updating circular pattern.
Provides real-time display of angle, radians, and magnitude as the plot progresses.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
A terminal that supports ANSI escape sequences.
Clone the repository or download the script.
